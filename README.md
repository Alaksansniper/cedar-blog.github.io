        <p>My family consists of my mother, father, brother, and sister. My sister is in collage at Boise State Universety applying for economics and political sciences. My mother works for many employers to appraise houses to see how much it can be bought for. My father works on the north slope for Parker Drilling. My brother is twelve years old and hates any type of game that includes guns"every game I play."</p>
        
     <h2 id = "pets">My Pets</h2> 
     <p> Our family consists of a majority of pets, he have 4 dogs and have one cat, who acts like another dog, we like to chase the  dogs to make them get their exercise. Other times in summer I will practice hockey with a tennis ball and shoot it at a target and the dogs will go fetch it. </p>
     
     <h2 id = "hockey">My Hockey team</h2>
     <p>I play for the hockey team of the alaska avalanche. I play many positions this year dependant on who it at the game and who is not. I currently have been playing both sided defence and have gotten 2 goals doing so, I have also saved many shots and stopped many breakaways. My total amount of points this year are 5 goals and 10 assists.</p>
     
     <h2 id = "airsoft">Favorite game</h2>
     <p>My favorite real life game is airsoft because it is one of the only games I am alowed to practice aim, strategy, and diversion. These are things I have gotten really good at because i have practiced them for countless of my sports. I played a match just yesterday with my freind Austin, Cole, Branson, and Stephan. We did 2v2v1 and i was the one. my strategy was to lead Austins team towards bransons to get them to fight while I went behind branson to get their guns. Branson got Austin and cole ran away but after I ran him down I had his gun and mine. Branson and Stephan were stuck in a tree fort because I kept them under heavy fire for about four minutes and they surrendered. </p>
